 Write a countdown alarm program that uses delegates to notify anyone who is interested 
that the designated amount of time has passed. You’ll need a class to simulate the countdown 
clock that accepts a message and a number of seconds to wait (supplied by the user). After 
waiting the appropriate amount of time, the countdown clock should call the delegate and pass 
the message to any registered observers. (When you’re calculating the time to wait, remember that 
Thread.Sleep( ) takes an argument in milliseconds, and requires a using System.Threading statement.) 
tCreate an observer class as well that echoes the received message to the console.
